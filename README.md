# Discussion

The authors hope that the delcaration will be the _start_ of a course of action which leads to improving the visibility and impact of African science. This goal will, however involve much discussion, refinement and hopefully positive exchange of comment between research communities and their members. We encourage the use of the [African e-Infrastructures Forum](http://discourse.sci-gaia.eu)
